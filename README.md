Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissors app.

This app was a simple (not meant to be beautiful) side project made to show javascript logic in use within the React library.

You will find conditional rendering based not only on your choice but that of a computer state, which itself is based on the use of a randomNum state equal to Math.random().

Rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Paper beats Rock

Scissors beats Paper

Two like choices are a Tie
